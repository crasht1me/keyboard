# keyboard

This aim of this repo is to make it easier to make yourself the keyboard that you want.

The source, 3D models and blog posts are there to practically show how you can make your unique keyboard. 

A simple computer keyboard can be made by:
- 3D printing the 3 parts for the bottom, switch plate and keycaps
- buying: mechanical switches that you like, a small MCU, wires and diodes
- soldering the switches
- using the .ino code to learn how a simple, but fully functional, keyboard works
- putting it all together with bolts
